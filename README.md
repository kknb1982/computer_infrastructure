# Downloading and timestamping data manually and automatically


## Introduction
This repository contains a git hub action to run a script (`weather.sh`) to download the weather data for Athenry on a daily basis. How this repository was set up and the `weather.sh` script was written is described in `weather.ipynb` (a Jupyter notebook). This repository was created as part of my course work for the Computer Infrastructre module in my HDip in Computer Science in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technical University, Ireland.

## Weather Jupyter Notebook 
The [Weather notebook](https://github.com/kknb1982/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.ipynb) is written as a Jupyter notebook and can be opened directly from Visual Studio Code or GitHub codespaces. Jupyter allows the writing of a notebook with markdown and embedded code blocks, in this case most of the code is in Python

## GitHub Actions: Automated Weather Data Download
In the `.github/workflows` directory is a `weather_data.yml` this code automates downloading the weather data from
